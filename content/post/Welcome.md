I created this Blog a few months ago, with so many ideas and yet when the website was up and running, I did not bother to create even one blog post.
So here is the first post. After working for about 7 years in a Large Corporate Tech company, I have many things to share, either code-oriented, or people oriented?
If you also work at a tech company and live the programmer life, then you will know what I mean.

See you on the second post!

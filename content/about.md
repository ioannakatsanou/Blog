For the past 6 years I have been working as a programmer.

During that time I have gone through many programming work-related stages and have witnessed some incredible episodes at the work environment.

You might know what I am talking about if you are also a programmer otherwise you might need to stretch your imagination. 

Ι decided to write this blog in order to share my adventures with you.

These may be accurate, or may have a dose of imagination – It is up to the reader to decide.

The names, characters, places and incidents  mentioned are  fictional. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, is entirely coincidental.

For questions/ideas/discussion please feel free to contact my through the contact form in the contact page. 

Have fun!

Having 6 years of experience working as a programmer, I have passed through many programming work-related phases. I have witnessed unspoken and unbelievable things at the work environment, things that maybe some of you -if you are also in the programming world- know what I am talking about, and some others have only imagined.

This blog is to share my stories with the whole world. Stories may be true, or may have a dose of imagination – I leave that on the reader’s choice and point of view.

Mentioned people, if any, are a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of my imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.

For questions/ideas/discussion please feel free to contact my through the contact form in the contact page.

Don't forget to have fun!

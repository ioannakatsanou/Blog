During that time I have gone through many programming work-related stages and have witnessed some incredible episodes at the work environment.
You might know what I am talking about if you are also a programmer otherwise you might need to stretch your imagination.
Ι decided to write this blog in order to share my adventures with you.
These may be accurate, or may have a dose of imagination – It is up to the reader to decide.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ioannakatsanou.github.io/Blog/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ioannakatsanou.github.io/Blog/contact/</guid><description> To contact, please fill out the form below.

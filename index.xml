I have witnessed unspoken and unbelievable things at the work environment, things that maybe some of you -if you are also in the programming world- know what I am talking about, and some others have only imagined.
This blog is to share my stories with the whole world. Stories may be true, or may have a dose of imagination – I leave that on the reader’s choice and point of view.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ioannakatsanou.github.io/Blog/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ioannakatsanou.github.io/Blog/contact/</guid><description> To contact, please fill out the form below.
